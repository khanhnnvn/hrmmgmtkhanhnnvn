  # Fix all RLS policies for anonymous access

  This migration ensures that anonymous users can properly access the job application functionality
  by adding necessary RLS policies for all related tables.

  ## Changes Made:
  1. **Candidates table**: Allow anonymous users to insert applications
  2. **Positions table**: Allow anonymous users to read open positions
  3. **Audit logs table**: Allow anonymous users to create audit entries
  4. **Users table**: Ensure proper read access for authentication
  5. **Interview sessions**: Ensure proper access for related operations

  ## Security Notes:
  - Anonymous users can only insert candidates and read open positions
  - All other operations remain restricted to authenticated users
  - Existing security policies for authenticated users are preserved
